Assumed inputs: gross salaries of 6,000만 and 5,000만 원, cash of 2억 원 and a loan rate. All are labelled as assumptions on screen. These numbers are from before stage 15, which compares homes of the same size and counts walking commutes. The table shows differences; which matters more is the customer's call.

| 19–19j | UI overhaul: two-column chat with one run button over the map, a light basemap with roads and price pills, scannable candidate rows, the result as an A·B table, a constant-size train pin, people named 나 / 배우자, a landing that shows the three steps; fixes for an invisible dialog that ate clicks, moment links and fractional minutes | [`19a`](../briefs/19a-chat-layout.md) … [`19j`](../briefs/19j-float-remain.md) |
| 20a–20g | The 3D view, rebuilt from user feedback: no crawling when the camera moves (full-res pass, MSAA/FXAA, gentle Kuwahara, one road layer); names on buildings, complexes and daily places with a 건축물대장 hover card; the hero says how this scene counts toward the result ("오늘 출근 44분 = 걷기 14분 + 지하철 26분 + 기다림 4분"); real VWorld aerial photos on the ground and roofs through a no-store dev proxy, credit on screen; follow mode you can zoom and orbit, 동네 전체 / 따라가기, the route and destination on the ground, now-first panel, whole numbers | [`20a`](../briefs/20a-no-shimmer.md) … [`20g`](../briefs/20g-wheel-delta.md) |
| 21a–21c | A first-time user's own sentence works end to end: 강남역으로 parsed (으로 before 로), housing kind honoured (오피스텔), nothing asked twice and one question at a time, no run without a workplace (station autocomplete, or 출근 안 해요), no false "같아요", commute sentence from the shown numbers, lot-number names readable, map pills never stack, station names, the map fits close candidates | [`21a`](../briefs/21a-first-user-flow.md) … [`21c`](../briefs/21c-map-fit.md) |
| 22a–22c | Public site on GitHub Pages: base-aware data URLs and links, a static mode with no /api calls (model and VWorld keys never reach the browser), runtime data shipped as a release asset (never committed), and a fix for the chat's run worker that was not bundled in production builds | [`22a`](../briefs/22a-github-pages.md) … [`22c`](../briefs/22c-chat-worker-build.md) |
| 23–25 | A relay that keeps every key server-side (Vercel or docker compose); the English UI (i18n core, whole-sentence translation, units); a light basemap | [`23a`](../briefs/23a-relay.md) … [`25a`](../briefs/25a-map-basemap.md) |
| 26a–26z2 | A US area around Meta HQ in Menlo Park: scene, real homes, chat search, bike commutes in the engine, US map sources and heights; phone layout, aerial thumbnails, the Ithaca name, English Muse replies | [`26a`](../briefs/26a-us-area.md) … [`26z2`](../briefs/26z2-phone-tray.md) |
| 27a–27j2 | Chat first: a streaming agent, Muse writes the diary, map pins, neighbourhood scenes, Muse recovers after a failed tool call | [`27a`](../briefs/27a-chat-first.md) … [`27j2`](../briefs/27j2-reply-counter.md) |
| 28a–28g | Design tokens, Powered by Muse, the landing page | [`28a`](../briefs/28a-design-doc.md) … [`28g`](../briefs/28g-landing-finish.md) |
| 29a1–29a14 | Judge path: a recorded month that replays without a key, English trust pass, the landing's try panel, US sources (Zillow ZORI, OSM US), internal ids kept out of answers, map pins that match the card, link previews | [`29a1`](../briefs/29a1-english-trust.md) … [`29a14`](../briefs/29a14-og-image.md) |
| 29b–29b2 | Voice input with Muse Voice Transcribe 1.0 through the relay | [`29b`](../briefs/29b-voice-input.md), [`29b2`](../briefs/29b2-mic-style.md) |

| 29k1–29k3 | The report passes only on real numbers (member ids match the engine, no number-free sentences, cited records say how and when, no padding); map pins lead with the commute when every home shares one ZIP rent | [`29k1`](../briefs/29k1-report-members-no-empty-pass.md), [`29k2`](../briefs/29k2-pins-commute-first-check-tags.md), [`29k3`](../briefs/29k3-report-no-padding.md) |
