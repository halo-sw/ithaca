# Evidence: real Meta model calls

These files are unedited request/response pairs from real calls to Meta models, captured on 2026-10-31. The only change is that the `Authorization` header is replaced with `[REDACTED]`.

| File | Model | Endpoint | Calls | Captured (UTC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`muse-spark-1.3-2026-10-31.json`](muse-spark-1.3-2026-10-31.json) | `muse-spark-1.3` | `https://api.meta.ai/v1/chat/completions` | 3, all HTTP 200 | 05:23:56 – 05:24:08 |
| [`muse-spark-open-2026-10-31.json`](muse-spark-open-2026-10-31.json) | `meta-models/muse-spark-open-1026` (Baseten) | `https://inference.baseten.co/v1/chat/completions` | 3, all HTTP 200 | 05:28:02 – 05:28:08 |

## How they were captured

- **Path.** The product's own code path made the calls: `judgeHome` in [`web/src/judge/run.js`](../../web/src/judge/run.js) → `judgeSingle` → `complete` in [`web/src/judge/providers.js`](../../web/src/judge/providers.js).
- **Recording.** The capture passed a `fetchImpl` that records each request and response and then forwards it unchanged.
- **Scenario.** `scenarios/demo-two-homes.json`, home A: the household's first decisions in the run.
- **Settings.** `reasoning_effort: "low"`, `max_tokens: 2000`, structured output (`response_format: json_schema`).
- **What each call contains.**
  - The request: the decision prompt, which has only the context the engine computed (the member, the time of day, the options with their minutes and metres).
  - The response: the response `id`, `model`, `created`, the JSON choice with its reasons, and `usage`, including reasoning tokens.

## What the calls show

- **The model only chooses; the engine supplies every number.**
  - The prompt lists the options with the engine's minutes and metres. The model returns a `chosen_key` and short reasons.
  - [`web/src/judge/guards.js`](../../web/src/judge/guards.js) rejects a reply whose reason quotes a number that is not in the prompt.
- **Both models are asked the same thing.**
  - The same prompt goes to both models. Spark 1.3 picked `home` for the first decision and Spark Open picked `park`.
  - The full 154-decision comparison is in [`scenarios/decisions/compare-1029/`](../../scenarios/decisions/compare-1029/).

## What is not here

- **No fine-tuning.** Spark Open is served by Baseten as published; we did not fine-tune it.
- **No consult-chat transcripts.** The chat agent (`web/src/consult/agent.js`) uses the same provider module, through `completeWithTools`.
- **No customer data.** The household in these prompts is a synthetic scenario.

## Muse Image (2026-11-03)

| File | Model | Endpoint | Calls | Captured (UTC) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`muse-image-2026-11-03.json`](muse-image-2026-11-03.json) | `muse-image-1.0` | `https://api.meta.ai/v1/images/generations` | 2, both HTTP 200 | 2026-11-03 14:22:21 – 14:22:42 |

- **The path.** Both calls went through Ithaca's own handler, `createDiaryImageHandler` in [`web/src/consult/diary-image.js`](../../web/src/consult/diary-image.js), with a recording `fetchImpl`.
- **What the browser sends.** Only `{ kind, minute, region }`. The handler builds the prompt from a fixed scene list, so no diary or customer text reaches the model.
- **The two scenes.**
  - A commute at 07:32 in Korea, from `seoul-couple.json`, home A, day 1.
  - A park walk at 18:32 in the US, from `menlo-month.json`, home B, day 26.
- **Edits.** The `Authorization` header is replaced with `[REDACTED]`. Each returned image's base64 is replaced with its size and SHA-256. The images are not in the repo.
- **How the app labels them.** The app shows each picture with "Muse Image 일러스트 · 실제 장소 사진이 아니에요" (illustration by Muse Image, not a photo of the real place).
